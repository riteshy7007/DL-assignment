****Variational Autoencoders (VAE) with Frey Face Dataset
Overview:
This project implements Variational Autoencoders (VAE) using the Frey Face dataset. The trained network learns a probabilistic latent space representation of the face images. It allows sampling from the learned distribution by varying different latent variables, demonstrating that the network has learned meaningful latent variables.
****
Dependencies:
TensorFlow
NumPy
Matplotlib
scipy.io
Installation:
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib scipy
Usage:
Download the Frey Face dataset from the provided link and place it in the project directory.
**Usage: use a Google collab to run it and attach   file in '/content/sample_data/frey_rawface.mat'the file in nin.**
After training, sample points from the learned distribution by varying different latent variables to visualize the generated face images.
Results:
The project demonstrates the effectiveness of Variational Autoencoders in learning a meaningful latent space representation of face images. It showcases the ability to generate new face samples by sampling from the learned distribution and varying different latent variables.
